 Real-Time IDS Simulation using Flask & Scapy

This project demonstrates a simplified Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Python. It uses the **Scapy** library for network packet sniffing and **Flask** for the web interface.

 Features

- Manual IP Threat Check: Users can input an IP address and check if it exists in a pre-defined database of malicious IPs.
- Real-Time IP Monitoring: Continuously scans incoming packets and checks IPs against the threat database to simulate real-time intrusion detection.

Tech Stack

- Backend: Python, Flask
- Network Monitoring: Scapy
- Web Interface: HTML (via Flask templates)
